# Summary

This is a small treebank of grammatical examples for Azerbaijani. The
treebank tries to be neutral about the particular variety (North or
South Azerbaijani, hence, uses the ISO code for the macrolanguage
(`az`).

# Introduction

The Azerbaijani-TueCL treebank consists of 148 sentences, which include 20 sentences from Cairo and 119 sentences provided by the [UD Turkic Group](https://github.com/ud-turkic). This treebank is a part of the UD Turkic Treebank. To account for instances of pronominal subject omission, we have added 9 additional sentences (versions) to the Cairo corpus.
It's important to note that the original grammatical sentences are in Turkish, and some constructions and translations do not exist in Azerbaijani. As a result, we have included duplicate sentences, which are as follows:  
- Sentence IDs 14 and 15  
- Sentence IDs 35, 36, and 37  
- Sentence IDs 54 and 55  
- Sentence IDs 74 and 75  
- Sentence IDs 78 and 79  
- Sentence IDs 80 and 81  
Currently, Azerbaijani is written using three different alphabets: the Persian alphabet in the South, and the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets in the North. The current treebank only includes sentences written in the Latin script, with plans to include sentences in the Perso-Arabic alphabet in the future. Translations of all sentences into English are also available.
