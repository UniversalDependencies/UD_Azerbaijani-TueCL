# Summary

This is a small treebank of grammatical examples for Azerbaijani. The
treebank tries to be neutral about the particular variety (North or
South Azerbaijani, hence uses the ISO code for the macrolanguage
(`az`).

# Introduction

Azerbaijani-TueCL contains totaly ~110 sentences including 20 Cairo sentences, and ~90 sentences suggested by [UD Turkic Group](https://github.com/ud-turkic). This treebank is a part of UD Turkic Treebank. 
Translation of all sentences are available in English, Turkish and Kyrgyz languages.

Azerbaijani is written currently in three different alphabets: the Persian alphabet in the South, the Cyrillic and Latin alphabets in the North. This treebank contains only sentences with Latin script now, and more sentences in (Arabic-based) Persian alphabet will be added.
